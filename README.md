## 📖 Introduction

This project demonstrates **web scraping** in R to extract **global COVID-19 case data** from Wikipedia.  
The scraped data is **cleaned, saved to CSV, and visualized** using bar charts for quick interpretation.  

**Why this project?**  
In the era of big data, being able to automatically extract, process, and visualize information from the web is an essential skill for data scientists and analysts.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **[R](https://www.r-project.org/)** – Main programming language  
- **[rvest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/index.html)** – For web scraping  
- **[dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)** – For data manipulation  
- **[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)** – For data visualization

## 🚀 Features

✔ Extracts up-to-date COVID-19 case numbers from Wikipedia  
✔ Cleans and formats the dataset  
✔ Saves results locally as CSV  
✔ Generates a bar chart for visual insights

## ▶️ Run the Project in Google Colab

You can run this project directly in your browser without installing anything:  
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](YOUR_COLAB_NOTEBOOK_LINK)



## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Load the libraries

```r
library(rvest)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```
2. Read the Wikipedia page
   
```r
url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_COVID-19_cases"
page <- read_html(url)

```
  
3. Extract the data table

```r
table <- page %>% html_node("table") %>% html_table(fill = TRUE)
```

4. Clean and save the data

```r
covid_data <- table %>%
  select(Country = 1, Cases = 2) %>%
  filter(!is.na(Cases)) %>%
  mutate(Cases = as.numeric(gsub(",", "", Cases)))

write.csv(covid_data, "covid19.csv", row.names = FALSE)

```

5. Visualize the data
   
```r
ggplot(covid_data, aes(x = reorder(Country, -Cases), y = Cases)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#0073C2FF") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "COVID-19 Cases by Country",
    x = "Country",
    y = "Number of Cases"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()


```

## 📂 Project Structure

The project directory contains the following files:



📌 **Details**:  
- **IBM Project.R** – Core script where the web scraping process is implemented using `rvest`, data is processed with `dplyr`, and visualizations are generated using `ggplot2`.  
- **covid19.csv** – CSV file generated by the script containing the cleaned dataset.  
- **README.md** – This documentation file, explaining the project, installation, and usage.  


## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Scrape multiple data tables (e.g., deaths, vaccination rates)
- Automate daily updates and store data historically
- Deploy as an interactive dashboard with Shiny
